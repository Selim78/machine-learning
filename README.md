# Projects submissions for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree curriculum

## List of completed projects:

- **Predicting Boston Housing Prices [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Selim78/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb)** </br>
Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.</br>
  `Supervised Learning`, `Cross Validation (k-fold, shuffle-split)`, `Learning Curves`, `Model Tuning (Grid-search, Randomized-search)`, `Metric Performance`
- **Finding Donors for a Charity [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Selim78/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb)** </br>
  Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.</br>
  `Preprocessing`, `Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)`,  `Naive Bayes`, `sklearn`, `Model Fitting and Prediction`, `Decision Trees`, `Neural Networks`, `Support Vector Machines`, `K-Nearest Neighbors`
- **Creating Customer Segments [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Selim78/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb)**  </br>
  Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis. </br>
  `Clustering`, `sklearn`, `PCA/ICA`, `Visualizing Data`, `Feature Selection`
- **Training a Smartcab to Drive [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Selim78/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/smartcab/smartcab.ipynb)** </br>
  Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.</br>
  `Reinforcement Learning`, `Q-Learning`, `Optimization Modeling`, `Model Tuning`
- **Other Practise Projects** `Keras`, `MLP`, `CNN`, `data augmentation`, `transfer learning`, `AWS Cloud Computing`
